# java-playground

Welcome to my Java Playground! 🛠️  
This repository contains small Java projects and experiments I've created while learning and exploring the Java programming language.

The focus is on understanding core concepts like OOP, data structures, algorithms, and clean code – while keeping things simple, well-structured, and beginner-friendly.

## 📁 Structure

Each folder in this repository is a self-contained project or demo, with its own purpose and learning goal.  
Here’s what you’ll typically find inside each project:

- Entry point like `Main.java` or similar
- Additional classes and utilities
- Simple and clean console output
- Clear folder naming based on the topic

## 🎯 Why this repo?

I'm building this repo as part of my journey to improve my Java skills from the ground up.  
It’s meant to be a reference for myself – and maybe a helpful starting point for others, too.

No frameworks, no libraries – just pure Java. 🚀

## ✅ Topics I have in mind (so far)

- Variables, types, and operators
- Control flow (if, switch, loops)
- Methods and parameters
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Arrays and collections
- Basic algorithms and logic
- Console-based programs (of course)

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This repo will continue to grow as I experiment with new ideas and learn more advanced topics.

Feel free to explore, fork, or suggest improvements!
